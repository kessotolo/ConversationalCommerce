# Edge Cases Documentation

This document outlines the edge cases we've identified and how the system handles them, with special attention to mobile optimization and offline support scenarios.

## Mobile Device Edge Cases

### Ultra Low-End Devices

**Scenario**: User accessing the platform on an extremely low-end device (e.g., Android 4-5, <1GB RAM)

**Handling**:
- MobileOptimizationService detects device capabilities and applies "minimal" mode
- All animations are disabled
- Image quality is reduced to minimum acceptable level
- Component rendering is simplified (fewer elements, simpler layouts)
- Data is paginated in smaller chunks (5-10 items vs. 20-50)
- Charts and complex visualizations are replaced with simple tables
- Background processes are minimized or eliminated
- Local storage usage is more aggressive to reduce API calls

**Testing**: Validate using Chrome DevTools with 4x CPU throttling and 1GB memory limitation

### Unusual Screen Dimensions

**Scenario**: Ultra-wide, ultra-narrow, or non-standard aspect ratio screens

**Handling**:
- Responsive breakpoints handle edge dimensions (both extremely small and large)
- Flex-based layouts avoid fixed dimensions where possible
- Min/max constraints prevent layout breaking at extreme dimensions
- Orientation changes trigger appropriate layout adjustments
- Touch targets maintain minimum size regardless of screen dimensions

**Testing**: Test with various viewport dimensions including 240px width (feature phones) and ultrawide displays

## Network Edge Cases

### Intermittent Connectivity

**Scenario**: User experiences frequent, brief network dropouts (common in developing regions)

**Handling**:
- OfflineDataHandler detects brief outages and handles reconnection transparently
- Non-blocking UI updates prevent freezing during connectivity changes
- Request queuing system for API calls during intermittent connectivity
- Automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Background synchronization when connection is restored
- Clear indicators when operating in degraded connectivity mode

**Testing**: Simulate using Chrome DevTools' network throttling with custom offline patterns (online for 10s, offline for 5s)

### Offline During Critical Flow

**Scenario**: User loses connectivity during checkout or payment process

**Handling**:
- Transaction data stored locally with unique idempotency keys
- Clear UI indicators show pending transaction status
- Automatic retry when connectivity returns
- Conflict resolution if server state differs from client assumption
- Ability to manually retry failed operations
- Offline receipts that can be verified later

**Testing**: Force offline mode during payment submission and verify retry behavior works correctly

### Extremely High Latency

**Scenario**: User on satellite or extremely congested network with >2000ms latency

**Handling**:
- Optimistic UI updates to prevent perceived freezing
- Progressive loading of content with meaningful loading states
- Reduced payload sizes for critical transactions
- Bundling of requests to minimize round-trips
- Extended timeout values for critical operations

**Testing**: Test with 2000-5000ms artificial latency and verify system remains usable

## Data Edge Cases

### Corrupted Cache Data

**Scenario**: LocalStorage or IndexedDB cache becomes corrupted

**Handling**:
- Validation of cache integrity before use
- Automatic fallback to network if cache validation fails
- Cache versioning system to handle schema changes
- Ability to clear and rebuild cache
- Graceful error handling for corrupted entries

**Testing**: Manually corrupt localStorage data and verify system recovery

### Storage Limitations

**Scenario**: Device has limited or nearly full storage

**Handling**:
- Check available storage before caching large datasets
- Graceful fallback when storage limits are reached
- LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy for cached data
- Size limits for individual cache entries
- Warning when approaching storage limits

**Testing**: Set artificial quota limitations in browser and verify graceful behavior

## Accessibility Edge Cases

### Screen Reader Compatibility

**Scenario**: User with visual impairment using screen reader

**Handling**:
- All TouchTargetArea components have proper aria attributes
- Dynamic content changes announce updates appropriately
- Focus management prevents keyboard traps
- Offline status changes are announced to screen readers
- Performance metrics are available through accessibility API

**Testing**: Test with VoiceOver (iOS), TalkBack (Android), and NVDA (Windows)

### Motor Impairments with Touch

**Scenario**: User with motor control difficulties using touch interface

**Handling**:
- TouchTargetArea components enforce minimum size
- Tap delay tolerance for users with tremors
- Reduced motion mode available
- Alternative input methods supported where possible
- Extended timeouts for multi-step processes

**Testing**: Test with motor impairment simulation tools and verify usability

## Browser Edge Cases

### Legacy Browser Support

**Scenario**: User on outdated browser version

**Handling**:
- Graceful feature detection and fallbacks
- Polyfills for essential modern APIs
- Core functionality works without requiring modern browser features
- Clear messaging when using unsupported browser
- Alternative paths for critical functions

**Testing**: Test on legacy browsers (IE11, older Chrome/Safari versions)

### WebView Environments

**Scenario**: App running in embedded WebView (e.g., in-app browser)

**Handling**:
- Detect WebView environment and adjust accordingly
- Handle limited storage quotas in some WebViews
- Manage WebView-specific quirks (iOS WKWebView offline detection issues)
- Appropriate user messaging for WebView limitations

**Testing**: Test in Android WebView and iOS WKWebView environments

## Performance Edge Cases

### Memory Leaks Under Low Memory

**Scenario**: Memory-constrained device running app for extended period

**Handling**:
- PerformanceMonitoring detects high memory usage trends
- Component cleanup on unmount is thoroughly verified
- Large data structures are garbage collected when not needed
- Memory-intensive features are disabled on low-memory devices
- Pagination prevents loading full datasets into memory

**Testing**: Long-running tests with memory profiling, particularly on limited devices

### CPU Spikes

**Scenario**: Extended high CPU usage causing device heating/battery drain

**Handling**:
- Performance monitoring detects sustained CPU usage
- Background tasks throttled when CPU usage is high
- Computationally intensive operations chunked into smaller tasks
- Debouncing and throttling for frequent user interactions
- Simplified rendering when CPU is constrained

**Testing**: Monitor CPU usage during stress testing with Chrome DevTools

## Recovery Strategies

### Corrupted Application State

**Scenario**: App reaches unrecoverable state due to data inconsistency

**Handling**:
- Global error boundary catches unhandled exceptions
- "Emergency reset" functionality to clear client state
- Telemetry captures state before corruption for diagnosis
- User-friendly recovery options presented
- Critical data preserved where possible during recovery

**Testing**: Force application into inconsistent states and verify recovery

### Failed API Version Mismatch

**Scenario**: Client using cached API data with schema that differs from current backend

**Handling**:
- API version headers included in all requests
- Schema validation for all cached response data
- Migration path for outdated cached data
- Clear cache when version mismatch detected
- Graceful error messages for version incompatibility

**Testing**: Simulate API version changes and verify handling of cached data
