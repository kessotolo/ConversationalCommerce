    resource_type="tenant",
    resource_id=str(tenant_id),
    tenant_id=tenant_id,
    details={"updated_fields": ["name", "logo_url"]}
)
```

## Admin Module Deployment Guide

### Architecture Overview

The admin module follows a multi-domain architecture to ensure strict separation between platform admin and tenant storefronts:

- **Super Admin Dashboard Domain**: `admin.yourplatform.com` - Platform administration for super admins
- **Tenant Storefront Domains**: `{tenant-subdomain}.yourplatform.com` or custom domains - Customer-facing storefronts
- **Tenant Admin Access**: Either through super admin impersonation or via `/admin` path on tenant domains
- **API Backend**: Common backend with domain-aware middleware and RBAC

### Deployment Requirements

- **Frontend**:
  - Vercel hosting with domain configuration
  - Environment variables for API endpoints and authentication
  - CORS and CSP configuration for cross-domain security

- **Backend**:
  - Railway deployment with PostgreSQL database
  - Domain-aware authentication middleware
  - Cross-domain CORS configuration
  - Role-based access control middleware

### Environment Variables

#### Backend Environment Variables
```
# Admin Configuration
ADMIN_DOMAIN=admin.yourplatform.com
BASE_DOMAIN=yourplatform.com
ADMIN_CORS_ORIGINS=https://admin.yourplatform.com
SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourcompany.com

# Security - NEW/UPDATED
SECRET_KEY=your-secure-secret-key
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS=7
ADMIN_ENFORCE_IP_RESTRICTIONS=true
ADMIN_REQUIRE_2FA=true
ADMIN_SESSION_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT=10
ADMIN_MODE=true

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@hostname/dbname
```

#### Frontend Environment Variables
```
# API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.yourplatform.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_DOMAIN=admin.yourplatform.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_DOMAIN=yourplatform.com

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://admin.yourplatform.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret
```

### Cross-Domain Security

1. **Cookie Isolation**:
   - Admin session cookies are domain-specific to `admin.yourplatform.com`
   - Tenant cookies are scoped to their respective domains
   - Prevents cookie leakage between admin and tenant applications

2. **JWT Token Audience Claims**:
   - Admin tokens include `aud: "admin-api"`
   - Tenant tokens include `aud: "tenant-api"` and `tenant_id`
   - Backend validates audience claims to prevent cross-domain token usage

3. **CORS Configuration**:
   - Strict origin validation for all API requests
   - Separate CORS policies for admin and tenant domains
   - Credential support for authenticated requests only

### Deployment Steps

1. **Backend Deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Apply database migrations for tenant model and RBAC
   cd backend
   alembic upgrade head

   # Deploy backend to Railway
   railway up
   ```

2. **Admin Dashboard Deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Build and deploy admin dashboard
   cd admin-dashboard
   npm run build
   vercel deploy --prod
   ```

3. **Domain Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Configure domains in Vercel
   vercel domains add admin.yourplatform.com
   vercel domains add *.yourplatform.com
   ```

### Testing Cross-Domain Authentication

1. **Separate Sessions Test**:
   - Log in to super admin dashboard at `admin.yourplatform.com`
   - Log in to tenant storefront at `{tenant}.yourplatform.com` (customer-facing store)
   - Verify sessions remain independent

2. **Token Validation Test**:
   - Attempt to use super admin token for tenant API access (should fail)
   - Attempt to use tenant token for admin API access (should fail)

3. **Impersonation Flow Test**:
   - Generate impersonation token as super admin
   - Use token to access tenant storefront as if you were the tenant owner
   - Verify proper permission scope during impersonation
   - End impersonation session and verify return to super admin context

### Local Testing Guide

#### Domain Structure for Local Testing

| Domain | Purpose | Who Accesses It |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| `admin.localhost` | Super admin platform dashboard | Platform administrators |

## Conclusion

This phased implementation plan provides a structured approach to building a comprehensive Super Admin and Security system for the ConversationalCommerce platform. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring that core functionality is implemented first before adding more advanced features.

By following this plan, we'll create a secure, usable, and powerful administrative system that enables platform governance while maintaining strict security controls and comprehensive observability.

### Security Middleware Implementation

The admin backend now enforces multiple layers of security:

#### 1. Global IP Allowlist Enforcement
- **Middleware**: `GlobalIPAllowlistMiddleware` protects all `/api/admin/*` endpoints
- **Service Integration**: Uses existing `IPAllowlistService` for allowlist management
- **Scope**: Enforces global IP allowlist entries for all admin access
- **Configuration**: Controlled via `ADMIN_ENFORCE_IP_RESTRICTIONS` environment variable

#### 2. Enhanced Security Headers
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS for all admin communications
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Prevents XSS and code injection attacks
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information leakage
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts access to sensitive browser features

#### 3. Staff Role Enforcement
- **Authentication**: All admin endpoints now require the platform-wide `"staff"` role
- **Authorization**: Enforced in `admin_user_from_token` dependency
- **Scope**: Platform-wide role (not tenant-scoped) for super admin access
- **Error Handling**: Clear HTTP 403 responses for unauthorized access

#### 4. CORS Restrictions
- **Admin Endpoints**: Only `https://admin.enwhe.io` is allowed for admin API access
- **Tenant Endpoints**: Separate CORS policy for tenant-facing APIs
- **Isolation**: Complete domain-level separation between admin and tenant access
