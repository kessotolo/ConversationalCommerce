# Contributing to ConversationalCommerce Backend

Thank you for contributing! Please follow these guidelines to ensure code quality, maintainability, and alignment with our multi-tenant, async, and secure architecture.

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Principles

- **Multi-Tenancy:** All features must support strict tenant isolation. Use tenant context from middleware/dependencies, never set tenant context in services or endpoints.
- **PostgreSQL RLS:** All tenant data is protected by Row-Level Security. Never bypass RLS or access data across tenants.
- **Async First:** All database access and business logic must be async. Do not mix sync and async DB sessions.
- **Service-Centric:** Endpoints should be thin, delegating all business logic to service classes (see OrderService pattern).
- **Extensibility:** Write code that is easy to extend for new tenants, endpoints, or features.

## üß™ Testing Best Practices

- Use async fixtures and sessions for all DB access in tests.
- Always use the `test_tenant` fixture for tests that touch tenant data.
- Ensure test isolation: no data leakage between tenants or test runs.
- Test RLS by verifying that data is only visible to the correct tenant.
- Standardize error response checks using the `{ "detail": ... }` format.

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling

- All API errors must use the standardized error response format:
  ```json
  { "detail": "Error message here" }
  ```
- See backend/docs/api/orders.md for examples.

## ‚ûï Adding New Features

- Use async DB sessions and ensure tenant context is set via dependency/middleware.
- Follow the thin-endpoint, service-centric pattern.
- Reference backend/README.md and docs/architecture.md for patterns and best practices.
- **For onboarding flows:**
  - Use the onboarding endpoints in `api/v1/endpoints/onboarding.py` and the `SellerOnboardingService` in `services/seller_onboarding_service.py` as your pattern.
  - All onboarding steps must log analytics/events using the ConversationEvent pattern (see backend/README.md for details).

## üîÑ API Versioning Guidelines

- **When to version:** Create a new version when making breaking changes to existing endpoints.
- **How to version:** Place new API endpoints in the `/api/v2/` directory structure.
- **Backward compatibility:** Never modify existing v1 endpoints in ways that break compatibility.
- **Documentation:** Update documentation for both v1 and v2 versions when adding new functionality.
- **Reference:** Follow the detailed guidelines in [backend/docs/api/api_versioning.md](backend/docs/api/api_versioning.md).
- **Testing:** Write tests for both v1 and v2 endpoints to ensure proper functionality.

## Orchestration, Modularization, and Service Size Limits
- All contributors must avoid large, monolithic files and "god objects."
- Use orchestration patterns: break down complex workflows into small, focused services, handlers, or orchestrators.
- Service files: Max 500 lines. Functions/methods: Max 50 lines. If exceeded, split into orchestrator + sub-services/handlers.
- Orchestrators coordinate; sub-services/handlers have single responsibility.
- All business logic must be in service classes/functions, not endpoints/controllers.
- Endpoints/controllers must be thin, delegating orchestration to services.
- For multi-step processes, use a dedicated orchestrator or handler that calls smaller, single-purpose services.
- Use events and handlers for decoupling (event-driven patterns).
- If a file grows beyond ~200 lines or covers more than one responsibility, split it.
- Never allow a file to become a "god file."
