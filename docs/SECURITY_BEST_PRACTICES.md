## Access Control

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Always assign the minimum permissions necessary for a role to function.
- **Role Separation**: Maintain clear separation between administrative roles based on responsibilities.
- **Regular Review**: Audit role assignments and permissions quarterly to ensure they remain appropriate.
- **Custom Role Caution**: When creating custom roles, be careful not to inadvertently grant excessive permissions.

### Permission Management

- **Permission Grouping**: Group permissions logically to simplify management and reduce error risk.
- **Critical Permissions**: Require additional approval or multi-admin authorization for critical operations.
- **Permission Inheritance**: Be aware of permission inheritance when assigning roles within hierarchies.
- **Permission Testing**: Test new permission configurations in a staging environment before applying to production.

### Access Restrictions

- **IP Allowlisting**: Restrict admin access to specific IP addresses or IP ranges where possible.
- **Time-Based Restrictions**: Consider implementing time-based access controls for sensitive admin operations.
- **Network Security**: Ensure admin operations are conducted only on secure networks, preferably via VPN.
- **Device Management**: Limit admin access to managed devices with appropriate security controls.

## Authentication

### Strong Authentication

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Require MFA for all administrative accounts without exception.
- **Strong Password Policy**: Enforce strong passwords with minimum 16 characters, complexity requirements, and regular rotation.
- **Biometric Options**: Consider supporting biometric authentication for admin accounts when available.
- **Hardware Security Keys**: Encourage or require hardware security keys for the highest-privilege accounts.

### Authentication Events

- **Failed Attempt Monitoring**: Closely monitor and alert on multiple failed authentication attempts.
- **Unusual Locations**: Flag and verify authentication attempts from unusual locations or devices.
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Limit or prohibit concurrent login sessions for administrative accounts.
- **Authentication Timing**: Be alert to authentication attempts outside normal working hours.

### Recovery Procedures

- **Secure Recovery Process**: Implement a secure admin account recovery process requiring multiple forms of verification.
- **Recovery Authorization**: Require second-party authorization for admin account recovery operations.
- **Recovery Audit**: Log and review all account recovery actions in detail.
- **Emergency Access**: Maintain a secure emergency access procedure for critical situations.

## Session Management

### Session Security

- **Short Session Duration**: Set admin session timeouts to 30 minutes or less.
- **Inactivity Timeouts**: Automatically terminate sessions after 10 minutes of inactivity.
- **Secure Session Storage**: Use secure, encrypted session storage mechanisms.
- **Session Binding**: Bind sessions to IP addresses and device fingerprints where possible.

### Session Controls

- **Force Re-authentication**: Require re-authentication for sensitive operations regardless of session status.

### Audit and Review

- **Comprehensive Logging**: Log the complete details of all impersonation sessions.
- **Video Recording**: Consider session recording for impersonation sessions accessing sensitive data.
- **Regular Audit**: Perform regular audits of impersonation activity to detect potential misuse.
- **Tenant Transparency**: Consider providing tenants with logs of admin impersonation of their users.

## Newly Implemented Security Features (2025)

### Global IP Allowlisting
- **Enforcement**: All admin endpoints are now protected by a global IP allowlist middleware
- **Management**: IP allowlist entries can be managed via the admin UI at `/admin/ip-allowlist/`
- **Scope**: Supports global, per-user, per-role, and per-tenant IP restrictions
- **Configuration**: Controlled via `ADMIN_ENFORCE_IP_RESTRICTIONS` environment variable

### Enhanced Security Headers
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All admin responses now include security headers:
  - `Strict-Transport-Security`: Forces HTTPS connections
  - `Content-Security-Policy`: Prevents XSS and injection attacks
  - `X-Frame-Options`: Prevents clickjacking
  - `X-Content-Type-Options`: Prevents MIME sniffing
  - `Referrer-Policy`: Controls referrer information
  - `Permissions-Policy`: Restricts browser feature access
- **Automatic Application**: Headers are applied via middleware to all admin responses

### Staff Role Enforcement
- **Platform-Wide Role**: All admin access now requires the `"staff"` role
- **Non-Tenant-Scoped**: The staff role is platform-wide, not limited to specific tenants
- **Authentication Integration**: Enforced in the `admin_user_from_token` dependency
- **Clear Error Handling**: HTTP 403 responses for users without staff role

### CORS Domain Isolation
- **Admin Domain Restriction**: Only `https://admin.enwhe.io` can access admin APIs
- **Complete Separation**: Admin and tenant APIs have separate CORS policies
- **Security Boundary**: Prevents cross-domain attacks between admin and tenant interfaces

### Best Practices for New Security Features

#### IP Allowlisting Management
- **Regular Review**: Review and update IP allowlist entries monthly
- **Least Privilege**: Only add IP ranges that are absolutely necessary
- **Documentation**: Document the purpose and owner of each IP range

#### Security Headers Monitoring
- **Header Validation**: Regularly verify that security headers are being applied
- **CSP Monitoring**: Monitor Content Security Policy violations and adjust as needed
- **Header Updates**: Keep security headers updated with current best practices

#### Staff Role Management
- **Role Assignment**: Only assign staff role to employees who need admin access
- **Regular Audit**: Quarterly review of staff role assignments
- **Role Separation**: Maintain clear separation between staff and regular tenant roles
- **Offboarding**: Immediately revoke staff role when employees leave
