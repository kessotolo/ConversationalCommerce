    User->>Checkout: Submit payment
    Checkout->>API: Process payment
    
    Note over Checkout,API: Network disruption occurs
    
    API--xCheckout: Connection lost
    Checkout->>ODH: Handle failed request
    ODH->>Cache: Store payment intent
    ODH->>User: Show retry UI with offline indicator
    
    Note over User,API: User waits for connection
    
    ODH->>ODH: Detect network restoration
    ODH->>Cache: Retrieve payment intent
    ODH->>API: Retry payment with idempotency key
    API-->>ODH: Confirm payment success
    ODH->>Checkout: Update payment status
    Checkout->>User: Show success confirmation
```

## Implementation Notes

### Device Detection Strategy

The device detection relies on multiple signals to ensure accurate classification:

1. User Agent parsing for basic device type
2. Screen size and pixel ratio for display capabilities
3. Hardware concurrency and memory (where available) for performance class
4. Connection type and effective bandwidth for network quality

### Performance Thresholds

The performance rating system uses the following thresholds:

| Metric | Good | Needs Improvement | Poor |
|--------|------|-------------------|------|
| LCP | ≤ 2500ms | ≤ 4000ms | > 4000ms |
| FID | ≤ 100ms | ≤ 300ms | > 300ms |
| CLS | ≤ 0.1 | ≤ 0.25 | > 0.25 |
| TTI | ≤ 3500ms | ≤ 7500ms | > 7500ms |
| Component Render | ≤ 50ms | ≤ 100ms | > 100ms |
| Data Load | ≤ 300ms | ≤ 1000ms | > 1000ms |

### Offline Data Strategy

The offline data handling strategy follows these principles:

1. **Cache First, Network Fallback** for non-critical read operations
2. **Network First, Cache Fallback** for critical or frequently changing data
3. **Cache Then Network** for initial fast loading with background refresh
4. **Optimistic Updates** for write operations during poor connectivity
5. **Conflict Resolution** strategy for syncing offline changes
