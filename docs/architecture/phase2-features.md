## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Async Database Operations

### Error Handling

- Backend: Custom exception hierarchy with standardized error responses
- Form validation with helpful user feedback
- Graceful degradation for network failures

### TypeScript Strict Mode

- All new components use TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- No use of `any` type, preferring explicit interfaces
- Extensive use of generic types for reusable components
- Full type safety across module boundaries
