## Testing Objectives

The primary objectives of this penetration testing are to:

- Identify exploitable vulnerabilities in the Super Admin features
- Determine the effectiveness of implemented security controls
- Test the resilience of tenant isolation mechanisms
- Verify the security of admin authentication and session management
- Assess the ability to escalate privileges within the system
- Evaluate the protection of sensitive administrative functions
- Test for data leakage across tenant boundaries

---

## Scope and Boundaries

### In Scope

- Super Admin authentication endpoints
- Administrative API endpoints
- Cross-tenant operation functionality
- Impersonation mechanisms
- Admin dashboard interface
- Context switching functionality
- Unified notification system
- Role-based access control implementation
- Session management for admin users

### Out of Scope

- Third-party integrations outside our control
- Physical security controls
- Social engineering attacks against personnel
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- Tenant-specific functionality not related to admin features

---

## Testing Methodology

The penetration testing will follow the OWASP Testing Guide methodology, with phases specifically adapted for testing administrative functionality:

### 1. Reconnaissance

- Identify all admin endpoints and interfaces
- Map the attack surface of admin functionality
- Document the authentication flow
- Identify role definitions and permission structures

### 2. Vulnerability Scanning

- Automated scanning of admin interfaces
- API endpoint fuzzing
- Common vulnerability testing
- Configuration analysis

### 3. Exploitation

- Attempt to bypass authentication
- Test for privilege escalation
- Attempt to access unauthorized tenant data
- Test for business logic flaws
- Session management attacks
- Cross-site scripting and injection attacks

### 4. Post-Exploitation

- Attempt to maintain unauthorized access
- Escalate privileges further if possible
- Extract sensitive information
- Move laterally between tenants
- Manipulate or bypass audit logging
