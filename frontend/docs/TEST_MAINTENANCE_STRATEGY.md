# Frontend Test Maintenance Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for maintaining and evolving the frontend test suite for the ConversationalCommerce project. Following these guidelines will help ensure tests remain stable, valuable, and up-to-date as the application evolves.

## Core Principles

1. **Tests as Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of how components and features should work.
2. **Stability First**: Prefer stable selectors and patterns that won't break with minor UI changes.
3. **Balanced Coverage**: Focus testing efforts on critical paths and high-risk areas.
4. **Update Tests with Code**: Tests should be updated alongside code changes, not as an afterthought.

## Test Maintenance Workflow

### When Implementing New Features

1. **Write Tests First (or Alongside)**: Consider a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach for critical features.
2. **Add Data-TestIDs**: Include `data-testid` attributes on key elements that tests will need to interact with.
3. **Create Helper Functions**: Extract repetitive test logic into utility functions.
4. **Document Special Cases**: Add comments explaining any non-obvious testing approaches.

### When Modifying Existing Features

1. **Run Affected Tests First**: Before making changes, identify and run tests that could be affected.
2. **Update Tests in the Same PR**: Never separate test updates from code changes.
3. **Check for Brittleness**: Evaluate if the current tests are too tied to implementation details.
4. **Refactor if Necessary**: If tests are brittle, refactor them to use more stable patterns.

### When Tests Fail in CI

1. **Investigate Immediately**: Test failures indicate either a bug or outdated tests - both deserve attention.
2. **Distinguish Flaky Tests**: If a test fails intermittently, mark it as `@flaky` and create a ticket to fix it.
3. **Fix or Skip**: Either fix the failing test or explicitly skip it with a clear explanation and ticket reference.
4. **Never Ignore**: Never ignore failing tests without documentation and a plan to fix them.

## Best Practices

### Selector Priority

Use selectors in this order of preference:

1. **Test IDs**: `data-testid="item-name"` (most stable)
2. **ARIA Roles**: `screen.getByRole('button', { name: /submit/i })`
3. **Form Labels**: `screen.getByLabelText(/username/i)`
4. **Text Content**: `screen.getByText(/welcome/i)` (can be brittle if text changes frequently)
5. **DOM Structure**: `container.querySelector('.class-name')` (most brittle, avoid when possible)

### Mocking Strategy

1. **Mock at the API Boundary**: Mock API calls, not internal implementation details.
2. **Keep Mock Data Realistic**: Mock data should be realistic and include edge cases.
3. **Version Mocks with API**: When the API changes, update related mocks.
4. **Explicit Mock Reset**: Always clear mocks between tests using `beforeEach`.

### Test Performance

1. **Group Related Tests**: Use `describe` blocks to group related tests for better organization.
2. **Optimize Setup**: Reuse setup code with `beforeEach` and `beforeAll` hooks.
3. **Targeted Tests**: Run only affected tests during development using Jest's pattern matching.
4. **Smart Timeouts**: Set appropriate timeouts based on the operation being tested.

## Test Review Checklist

When reviewing test code, check for:

- [ ] Appropriate test coverage for new/modified features
- [ ] Stable selectors that won't break with minor UI changes
- [ ] Proper mocking of external dependencies
- [ ] Realistic test scenarios including edge cases
- [ ] Clear test descriptions that explain what's being tested
- [ ] No unnecessary test duplication
- [ ] Tests that run quickly without unnecessary waits
- [ ] Proper cleanup to prevent test pollution

## Continuous Improvement

### Quarterly Test Review

Schedule a quarterly test health check to:

1. Identify and fix flaky tests
2. Measure and improve test coverage
3. Refactor brittle tests
4. Update documentation and testing strategies
5. Clean up outdated mocks and test fixtures

### Test Metrics to Track

- **Coverage**: Aim for 80%+ coverage of critical paths
- **Speed**: Full test suite should run in under 5 minutes
- **Flakiness Rate**: Track and reduce flaky test frequency
- **Maintenance Cost**: Time spent fixing broken tests vs. writing new ones

## Tools and Resources

### Tools for Test Maintenance

- **Jest Watch Mode**: `npm test -- --watch` for focused test development
- **Coverage Reports**: `npm test -- --coverage` to identify coverage gaps
- **Testing Library Debugging**: `screen.debug()` to visualize the DOM during tests
- **Test ID Highlighter**: Browser extension to visualize test IDs in the UI during development

### Additional Resources

- [Jest Documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)

## Integrating with CI/CD

- Set up automatic test runs on pull requests
- Block merges if tests fail
- Generate and publish coverage reports
- Notify the team about flaky tests
- Schedule regular full test suite runs (nightly)
