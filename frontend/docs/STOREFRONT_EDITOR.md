# Storefront Editor Technical Guide

This document provides a comprehensive technical guide to the Storefront Editor components, their interactions, and implementation details.

## Architecture Overview

The Storefront Editor follows a modular component architecture with a clear separation of concerns:

```
StorefrontEditor (Container)
â”œâ”€â”€ AssetManagement
â”œâ”€â”€ DraftManagement
â”œâ”€â”€ VersionHistory
â”œâ”€â”€ Permissions
â””â”€â”€ BannerLogoManagement
    â”œâ”€â”€ BannerManagement
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BannerList
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BannerDetail
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ CreateBannerModal
    â””â”€â”€ LogoManagement
        â”œâ”€â”€ LogoList
        â”œâ”€â”€ LogoDetail
        â””â”€â”€ CreateLogoModal
```

## Core Technical Principles

1. **Type Safety**: All components use TypeScript with strict type checking
2. **Consistent Error Handling**: API errors are handled consistently with user-friendly messages
3. **UX Considerations**: Loading states, empty states, and error states are handled with appropriate UI feedback
4. **Accessibility**: Components follow WCAG guidelines with proper ARIA attributes
5. **State Management**: Local component state with React hooks for simpler components, context for more complex shared state

## UUID Implementation

All identifiers use UUIDs following the PostgreSQL UUID type standards. This provides:

- Guaranteed uniqueness across distributed systems
- Improved security compared to sequential IDs
- Consistency with backend PostgreSQL implementation using `UUID(as_uuid=True)`

## Component Details

### Banner & Logo Management

#### BannerLogoManagement Component

**Purpose**: Container for banner and logo management with tab navigation
**Key Features**:

- Tab-based UI using Headless UI's Tab components
- Proper styling with Tailwind CSS
- Smooth tab transitions

**Implementation Notes**:

```tsx
// Simplified implementation
const BannerLogoManagement: React.FC<BannerLogoManagementProps> = ({ tenantId }) => {
  const [selectedTab, setSelectedTab] = useState(0);

  return (
    <Tab.Group selectedIndex={selectedTab} onChange={setSelectedTab}>
      <Tab.List>
        <Tab>Banners</Tab>
        <Tab>Logos</Tab>
      </Tab.List>
      <Tab.Panels>
        <Tab.Panel>
          <BannerManagement tenantId={tenantId} />
        </Tab.Panel>
        <Tab.Panel>
          <LogoManagement tenantId={tenantId} />
        </Tab.Panel>
      </Tab.Panels>
    </Tab.Group>
  );
};
```

#### BannerManagement Component

**Purpose**: Manages banner CRUD operations
**Key Features**:

- List/detail view structure
- Banner reordering with react-dnd
- Filtering and pagination

**API Interactions**:

- `getBanners`: Fetches banners with filtering and pagination
- `createBanner`: Creates a new banner
- `updateBanner`: Updates an existing banner
- `publishBanner`: Changes banner status to published
- `deleteBanner`: Removes a banner
- `reorderBanners`: Updates display order of banners

#### LogoManagement Component

**Purpose**: Manages logo CRUD operations
**Key Features**:

- List/detail view structure
- Filtering by logo type and status
- Scheduling with start/end dates

**API Interactions**:

- `getLogos`: Fetches logos with filtering and pagination
- `createLogo`: Creates a new logo
- `updateLogo`: Updates an existing logo
- `publishLogo`: Changes logo status to published
- `deleteLogo`: Removes a logo

**Logo Types**:

- PRIMARY: Main header logo
- SECONDARY: Alternative logo for specific contexts
- FOOTER: Logo used in the footer
- MOBILE: Optimized for mobile devices
- FAVICON: Browser tab icon

## Asset Integration

Both Banner and Logo management integrate with the Asset Management system:

1. **Asset Selection**: Both components allow selecting from existing assets
2. **Asset Preview**: Selected assets are displayed with proper image optimization
3. **Asset Usage Tracking**: Backend tracks which assets are used by banners/logos

## Permissions Integration

The Banner and Logo management respects the user's permissions:

- **Viewer**: Can view banners and logos but not edit
- **Editor**: Can create/edit banners and logos but not publish
- **Publisher**: Can publish banners and logos
- **Admin**: Full access including deletion

## Error Handling

All components implement consistent error handling:

```tsx
// Example error handling pattern
const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

try {
  await updateLogo(tenantId, logoId, logoData);
  setSuccessMessage('Logo updated successfully');
} catch (err) {
  setError('Failed to update logo. Please try again.');
  console.error('Error updating logo:', err);
}
```

## Testing Considerations

When testing these components:

1. **Mock API Responses**: Use mock implementations of API functions
2. **Test Different States**: Test loading, error, empty, and populated states
3. **Permission Testing**: Test with different user permission levels
4. **Edge Cases**: Test with various data scenarios (missing fields, etc.)

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements to consider:

1. **Batch Operations**: Support for bulk editing or deleting
2. **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated filtering options
3. **Image Optimization**: Integration with image optimization services
4. **A/B Testing**: Support for A/B testing of banners and logos
5. **Analytics Integration**: Track banner/logo performance

## Analytics & Event Logging Integration

- All major actions in the Storefront Editor (e.g., asset changes, banner/logo updates) can be logged as structured events using the ConversationEventLogger utility.
- Clerk integration ensures that user and tenant IDs are included in every event for accurate attribution.
- These events power analytics and monitoring dashboards, enabling real-time and historical insights.
- Event logging is type-safe and extensible; new event types can be added as needed.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure all required packages are installed

   ```
   npm install @headlessui/react @heroicons/react react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend
   ```

2. **Type Errors**: Check that all props match their expected types

3. **Styling Issues**: Verify Tailwind CSS classes are correct and applied

## API DTOs and Error Handling

### Main DTOs

#### Asset

```
interface Asset {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  asset_type: 'image' | 'video' | 'document' | 'audio';
  file_path: string;
  original_filename: string;
  file_size: number;
  is_optimized: boolean;
  usage_count: number;
  metadata: Record<string, unknown>;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at?: string;
}
```

#### Banner

```
interface Banner {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: Record<string, unknown>;
  start_date?: string;
  end_date?: string;
  status: 'draft' | 'published' | 'inactive';
  created_at: string;
  updated_at?: string;
}
```

#### Logo

```
interface Logo {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  logo_type: string; // e.g. 'primary', 'secondary', etc.
  asset_id: string;
  display_settings: Record<string, unknown>;
  responsive_settings: Record<string, unknown>;
  status: 'draft' | 'published' | 'inactive';
  start_date?: string;
  end_date?: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at?: string;
}
```

> **Note:** Align string union values with backend enums as needed. See TODOs in code for any pending backend alignment.

### Error Handling

All API/service errors should be handled using the `parseApiError` utility from `/lib/utils.ts`:

```
import { parseApiError } from '@/lib/utils';

try {
  await someApiCall();
} catch (error) {
  setError(parseApiError(error));
}
```

This ensures user-friendly, consistent error messages across the app.

## ðŸ§¹ Code Quality, Linting, and Type Safety

- **Strict ESLint Configuration**: Storefront Editor components follow strict architectural boundaries and type safety using ESLint and TypeScript. All cross-module imports must go through module public APIs (`index.ts`) or DTOs. Direct internal imports and bridge files are prohibited and will be flagged by CI.
- **No Bridge Files**: All legacy bridge files (e.g., `src/types/events.ts`, `src/types/websocket.ts`) have been removed. Types must be imported from their module's public API.
- **No Backup/Test Artifacts**: `.bak`, `.old`, and similar backup/test files are not allowed in the codebase and are regularly cleaned up.
- **CI Enforcement**: All PRs must pass lint (`npm run lint`) and type checks (`npm run type-check`). Violations block merges to protected branches.
- **Type Safety**: No `any` types are allowed. Use `unknown` with type guards for dynamic data. All module boundaries use explicit interfaces and DTOs.

### How to Fix Lint/Type Errors

- **Restricted Import**: Change your import to use the module's public API or DTO file.
- **Unused Variable/Import**: Remove or use the variable/import as needed.
- **Type Error**: Add or refine type annotations, avoid `any`, and use generics or type guards as appropriate.

## Type Safety, Enums, and Module Boundaries

- All Storefront Editor components use strict TypeScript with strong typing enforced via interfaces and enums (e.g., BannerStatus, LogoType).
- Direct module imports are required; bridge files and relative imports across module boundaries are not allowed (see ESLint rules).
- All domain models (Banner, Logo, Asset, Permission, etc.) are defined in their module directories and exported via public APIs.
- Type guards are used for all unknown/any API responses and event payloads.

## Error Handling

- All API/service errors are handled using the `parseApiError` utility from `/lib/utils.ts` for consistent, user-friendly error messages.

## Event Logging & Analytics

- All major actions (asset changes, banner/logo updates, permission changes, etc.) are logged as structured events using a type-safe event logger.
- Events include user and tenant IDs for accurate attribution and analytics.
- Event logging is extensible; new event types can be added as needed.

## Removal of Bridge Files

- All bridge files and legacy type/model aggregators have been removed.
- Types/interfaces must be imported directly from their module's public API.
