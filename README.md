# ConversationalCommerce

A modular monolith for mobile-first, AI-driven, multi-tenant commerce in Africa. Built for natural, chat-driven buying and selling—on WhatsApp, web, and beyond.

## 🏗️ Architecture

ConversationalCommerce follows a **true modular monolithic architecture** with self-contained services:

```
ConversationalCommerce/
├── backend/           # FastAPI backend service
├── frontend/          # Next.js frontend service
├── admin-dashboard/   # Next.js admin service
├── docs/             # Shared documentation
├── scripts/          # Shared deployment scripts
└── [minimal root]    # Only essential shared files
```

Each module is **completely self-contained** with its own:
- Dependencies (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`)
- Build configuration
- Testing setup
- Module-specific code organization

cd frontend && npm run build

# Admin Dashboard (with security features)
cd admin-dashboard && npm run build

# Backend (with security stack)
cd backend && python -m pytest
```

### Security Testing
Run comprehensive security tests:

```bash
# Backend security regression tests
cd backend && pytest tests/security/test_security_regression.py -v

# CI/CD security pipeline (triggered on push)
git push origin main
```
