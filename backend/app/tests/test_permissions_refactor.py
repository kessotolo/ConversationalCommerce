# These tests can be run with the project's existing test framework
# To run:
# 1. Ensure your test environment is properly set up with pytest
# 2. Run: pytest -xvs app/tests/test_permissions_refactor.py
#
# Note: These tests validate the structure and integration of the refactored 
# permissions modules. In a production environment, you would need more 
# comprehensive tests with proper database fixtures.
