## Background Jobs: Celery + Redis

- All notification and fulfillment events are now processed asynchronously using Celery tasks.
- Redis is used as the broker and result backend.
- This ensures robust retries, dead-lettering, and scalable event handling.

### Setup
1. Ensure Redis is running (locally or via Docker):
   ```bash
   docker run -p 6379:6379 redis:7
   ```
2. Install dependencies (already in requirements.txt):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start the Celery worker:
   ```bash
   celery -A app.core.celery_app.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
   ```

### How it works
- All order-related notifications and fulfillment events are enqueued as Celery tasks.
- Tasks are retried automatically on failure (see app/tasks.py for details).
- No notification or fulfillment logic runs in the request/response cycle.

### Troubleshooting
- If notifications or fulfillment actions are not processed, ensure Redis and the Celery worker are running.
- Check logs for errors and retry information.
